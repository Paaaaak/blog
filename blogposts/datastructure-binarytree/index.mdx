# Introduction

A tree is a commonly used data structure designed to represent <Underline>hierarchical relationships</Underline>. 
Each node in a tree contains a root value and a list of references to its child nodes. 
From a graph perspective, a tree can also be described as a <Underline>directed acyclic graph</Underline> (DAG) with N nodes and N-1 edges.
A <Highlight>Binary Tree</Highlight> is a specific and widely used type of tree. As the name implies, in a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children, 
known as the left child and the right child.

# Anatomy of a tree
Let's look through some common terms of tree.
<CustomImage src={'/blogposts-assets/datastructure-binarytree/tree.png'} alt={'image'} width={400} height={500} caption={''} />
## 1. Node
The circles in the tree are called Node and it's the fundamental unit of a tree.
It contains <Underline>Data</Underline> (e.g., a value or object) and <Underline>References</Underline> (or pointers) to its child nodes.
Example: In a binary tree, a node has at most two children (left and right).
## 2. Root
The root is the topmost node of the tree.
It is the starting point of the tree and has no parent.
## 3. Parent
A parent is a node that has one or more child nodes.
## 4. Child
A child is a node that is connected to a parent node.
A node can have zero or more children.
## 5. Sibling
Siblings are nodes that share the same parent.
## 6. Leaf (or External Node)
A leaf is a node with no children.
It is the end of a branch.10. 
## 7. Height
The height of a node is maximum length from root to any leaf.
Example: The height of the tree above is 4.
## 8. Level
The root node is at level 0, and the level increases by 1 for each step down the tree.
## 9. Depth
The depth of a node and the maximum depth (height) of a tree are different concepts.
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the given node.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to the deepest leaf node.<br></br>
Example: The depth of a node E is 2, the maximum depth of a tree is 4. 

# What is Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children. These children are typically referred to as left child & right child.

## Why is it Called a "Binary" Tree?
The term "binary" means two, and a binary tree is named so because:<br></br>
- âœ… Each node can have at most two children (not three, four, or more).<br></br>
- âœ… The structure follows a left-child and right-child arrangement.

This is different from a general tree, where a node can have any number of children.

# Types of Binary Trees
There are different types of binary trees, including:

## 1. Full Binary Tree 
Every node has 0 or 2 children (not just 1). If all leaves are on the same level, itâ€™s called a perfect binary tree<br></br>
## 2. Complete Binary Tree 
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level. All leaves are at the left-most possible positions.<br></br>
## 3. Perfect Binary Tree 
Every internal node has exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.<br></br>
## 4. Binary Search Tree (BST) 
A binary tree where the left subtree contains values smaller than the root, and the right subtree contains values greater than the root.<br></br>

# Binary Tree Traversal
Traversing a binary tree efficiently is crucial for many algorithms, including searching, sorting, and parsing hierarchical data. 
We will explore different types of binary tree traversal techniques.
<br></br>
Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a specific order. The two main categories of tree traversal are:
- âœ… Depth-First Traversal
- âœ… Breadth-First Traversal

# Depth-First Traversal (DFS)
Depth-First Traversal explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It can be implemented in three ways: Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order.
<br></br>
The image below is the simplest trick for binary tree traversal.

# Breadth-First Traversal (BFS)
Unlike DFS, Breadth-First Traversal (BFS) explores nodes level by level. This is often implemented using a queue.

## Level Order Traversal
Visit nodes level by level from left to right<br></br>
Used in: Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph
