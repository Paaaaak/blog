# What happens when you type URL in the adress bar?
Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend who lives far away.
<br></br>
Here's what happens:
<br></br> 

<h3>1. Writing the Address:</h3>
<br></br> 
First, you write your friend's name and address on the envelope (this is like typing google.com in the address bar). 
<br></br> 
You need to make sure you know where you're sending it!
<br></br> 

<h3>2. Finding the Right House:</h3> 
<br></br> 
The post office (like the <Highlight>DNS aka Domain Name System</Highlight>) looks up your friend’s address in its system, and finds the exact location (like an <Highlight>IP address</Highlight>, which is the computer’s ‘home’ on the internet).
<br></br> 

<h3>Using the Right Language (HTTP):</h3> 
<br></br> 
Before the letter is sent, you agree on the language you'll use to communicate with your friend, like English or another language. For computers, this agreed language is called <Highlight>HTTP</Highlight> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It’s a special way for computers to understand each other’s messages and make sure they talk the same way.
<br></br> 

<h3>3. Sending the Letter:</h3> 
<br></br> 
Once the post office knows where to send your letter, they use trucks and planes (like the internet) to deliver it to your friend’s house (this is like your computer sending a message to Google’s server).
<br></br> 

<h3>4. Knocking on the Door:</h3>
<br></br> 
The letter arrives at your friend’s house, and they open the door (this is like Google’s server receiving your message).
<br></br> 

<h3>5. Receiving the Response:</h3>
<br></br> 
Your friend writes a reply and sends it back to you (this is like Google sending the webpage back to your computer). 
<br></br> 
They might even send pictures, which are like the images and videos on the website.
<br></br> 

<h3>6. Reading the Letter:</h3>
<br></br> 
When you get the reply, you open it and read it (this is like your browser showing the webpage on your screen). 
<br></br> 
If your friend sent pictures, you’d look at those too!
<br></br> 

<h3>7. Getting More Mail:</h3>
<br></br> 
Sometimes, your friend needs to send more letters to show you all the information (this is like your browser loading extra things like images or videos).
