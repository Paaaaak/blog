# Introduction
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree that <Underline>maintains a sorted order</Underline> of elements, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
Similar to a regular binary tree, a Binary Search Tree (BST) can be traversed using preorder, inorder, postorder, or level-order methods. 
However, an important point to note is that the <Underline>inorder traversal</Underline> of a BST always results in elements being visited in ascending order. 
Because of this property, inorder traversal is the most commonly used method for traversing a BST.

The goal of this articles are followings.

- âœ… Grasp the fundamental properties of binary trees,
- âœ… Perform basic operations on a binary search tree,
- âœ… Understand the concept of a height-balanced BST.

# Properties of the Binary Search Tree
Each node of BST follows these properties:
## 1. Left Subtree Property: 
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
## 2. Right Subtree Property: 
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
## 3. No Duplicates: 
Typically, BSTs do not allow duplicate values.
## 4. Recursive Structure: 
Each left and right subtree must also be a BST.
<br></br>
Example of a BST:
<CustomImage src={'/blogposts-assets/datastructure-bst/bst.png'} alt={'image'} width={400} height={500} caption={''} />
<br></br>
The left subtree of 8 includes all nodes that are less than 8.<br></br>
The right subtree of 3 includes all nodes that are greater than 3.

# Time complexity of BST

The efficiency of operations in a BST depends on the height of the tree.

# Searching in a BST
## The search operation in a BST follows these steps:
1. Start at the root node.
2. If the key matches the root, return the node.
3. If the key is smaller, search in the left subtree.
4. If the key is greater, search in the right subtree.
5. Repeat this process recursively until the key is found or the subtree is empty.
## Best and Average Case <Highlight>O(log n)</Highlight>
If the BST is balanced, each comparison <Underline>halves the number of remaining nodes</Underline> to check. Thus, search takes O(log n) time.
## Worst Case <Highlight>O(n)</Highlight>
If the BST is <Underline>skewed</Underline> (all nodes form a linked list), every search must traverse all n nodes.
In this case, the time complexity degrades to O(n).

# Insersion in a BST
## Insertion follows a process similar to searching:
1. Start at the root.
2. Compare the key with the current node.
3. Move left if the key is smaller, move right if it's larger.
4. When an empty spot is found, insert the new node.
<br></br>
## Best & Average Case O(log n)
When the tree is balanced.<br></br>
## Worst Case O(n)
When inserting sorted data into an unbalanced BST.

# Deletion in a BST
## Deleting a node has three cases:
1. Node has no children -> Simply remove it.
2. Node has one child -> Replace it with its child.
3. Node has two children -> Replace it with its inorder successor (smallest node in right subtree).
## Best & Average Case O(log n)
If the tree is balanced, we find and delete the node in logarithmic time.
## Worst Case O(n)
If the tree is skewed, deletion takes linear time.
