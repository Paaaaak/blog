# Introduction
We will look through two different processing orders, First-in-First-out and Last-in-First-out 
and its two corresponding linear data structures, <Highlight>Queue</Highlight> and <Highlight>Stack</Highlight>.
<br></br>
By mastering Queue and Stack, you should be able to do solve problems by using BFS, DFS, and recursion algorithms.

# What is Queue?
In a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure, the first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be processed.

As illustrated in the image above, the queue follows the FIFO principle. 
The operation to add an element is known as <Highlight>enqueue</Highlight>, and the new element is always inserted at the rear of the queue. 
The operation to remove an element is called <Highlight>dequeue</Highlight>, and only the first element can be removed.

# How to implement Queue?
There is no Queue class in Java, since it follows the interface-based design principle, meaning Queue is an abstract contract that multiple classes 
(like LinkedList and ArrayDeque) implement.
This allows flexibility, you can choose an implementation based on your use case.
Check out Java collections below.

The followings are Queue implementation and build-in functions.
```
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
```

# What is Stack?
In a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, the most recently added element is processed first.

Unlike a queue, a stack follows the LIFO principle. 
The operation for adding an element to a stack is called <Highlight>push</Highlight>, and new elements are always placed at the top. 
However, unlike a queue, where elements are removed from the front, the <Highlight>pop</Highlight> operation in a stack always removes the most recently added element, 
making it the opposite of a queue.

# How to implement Stack?
The followings are Stack implementation and build-in functions.
```
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
```
